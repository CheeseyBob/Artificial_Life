DESIGN DOCUMENT: Artificial Life


~~ TO-DO ~~

> Re-assign mates after loading.
> Abstract out the WorldObject.load() method better.
> Save the window positions so you don't have to rearrange them every time you start the program.
> Properly balance cell energy input/output.
> Test different setups for matrix-type cells: number of memory/concept neurons, number of concept neuron layers, mutation rates.
> Even more varied food sources for cells.
> Introduce systems which cause change to the environment over time.
> Implement chemistry system.


~~ Bugs ~~

> Neural network viewer needs to be updated to work with matrix-type cells.
> Toggling map-mode sometimes doesn't work properly.
