DESIGN DOCUMENT: Artificial Life


~~ TO-DO ~~

> Test different setups for matrix-type cells: number of memory/concept neurons, number of concept neuron layers, mutation rates.
> Improved saving/loading. Separate handling the map and the cells. More options.
> More varied food sources for cells. Different types of food sources, in order to encourage multiple non-competing species.
> Introduce systems which cause change to the environment over time.
> Allow larger maps and have the display show only a scrollable section of the map.
> ASCII display mode.
> Improved cell-selecter: implement cursor for viewing/selecting world objects.
> Implement chemistry system.

~~ Bugs ~~

> Neural network viewer needs to be updated to work with matrix-type cells.
